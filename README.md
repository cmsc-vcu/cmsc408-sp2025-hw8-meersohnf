Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

# Overview

This repository contains the documentation and SQL analysis for the World Bank dataset, completed as part of Homework 8 for the CMSC 408 course at VCU. The project focuses on querying country-level data, cleaning and transforming datasets, and producing summary reports using SQL. It includes SQL tasks, reflections on learning, and dynamically generated outputs via Python and Quarto.

## Contents

General description of the World Bank dataset and its structure
SQL queries solving a sequence of structured exercises
Python scripts that:
Connect to the MySQL database
Execute and display SQL query results
Reflections on SQL skill development and problem-solving strategies

## Tools and Technologies Used

Quarto for dynamic report generation
Python (pandas, MySQL connector) for database interaction
MySQL as the database management system
phpMyAdmin and VS Code for database browsing and code editing

## Reflection

This project helped strengthen my SQL fundamentals, especially with SELECT, WHERE, aggregation, and subqueries. Complex multi-step problems, like those involving pivots and nested queries, were initially challenging but became manageable by breaking them down. I found that building step-by-step queries and visualizing the desired output first greatly improved my workflow. These skills will directly apply to future data analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation projects.
